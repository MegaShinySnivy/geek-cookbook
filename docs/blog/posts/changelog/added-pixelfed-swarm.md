# Added Pixelfed (swarm) Federated image sharing

New recipe - Pixelfed, like Instagram on the Fediverse. Check it out [here](/docs/recipes/pixelfed/)

<!-- more -->

[Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) is a free and ethical, open-source, federated (*i.e., decentralized*) social image sharing platform. As [Mastodon][mastodon] is to Twitter, so Pixelfed is to Instagram. Pixelfed uses the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users to interact with other users (*on other servers*) within the protocol, such as Mastodon, PeerTube, and Friendica, making Pixelfed a part of the Fediverse.

Much like Mastodon, Pixelfed implements chronological timelines with no implementation of content manipulation algorithms and is privacy-focused with no third party analytics or tracking. It only allows users over 16 years old to use.
