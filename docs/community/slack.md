## Get yer invite!

Joing a Slack server requires an invite. To get yours, go [here](https://communityinviter.com/apps/funkypenguin/geek-with-us), or use the form below:

<div id="CommunityInviter"></div>
<script>
  window.CommunityInviterAsyncInit = function () {
    CommunityInviter.init({
      app_url:'geek-with-us',
      team_id:'funkypenguin'
   })
  };

  (function(d, s, id){
    var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
    if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}
    js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
    js.src = "https://communityinviter.com/js/communityinviter.js";
    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
  }(document, 'script', 'Community_Inviter'));
</script>
