!!! question "Eh? What's this federated chat thing? Who own my data? (*/me puts on tin-foil hat*) !!"
    1. Matrix is a **federedated** group messaging platform. This means that you can sign in to **any** Matrix instance (*even your own!*), and participate in **any** room on **any** server!
    2. Also, since Matrix is an open standard, there are a [plethora of clients](https://matrix.org/clients/) you can use!

## How do I join the Matrix server?

1. If you already have an account on a matrix server (*a "home server"*), you can use it to access our server (*the magic of federation*). See the channels list below for details
2. If you don't have an account yet, [create one](https://m.fnky.nz), using your email address, or just login with GitHub
3. Use the WebUI, or get one of the [many available](https://matrix.org/clients/) mobile / desktop clients

## How to get help.

If you need assistance at any time there are a few commands that you can run in order to get help.

`!help` Shows help content.

`!faq` Shows frequently asked questions.

## Spread the love (inviting others)

Invite your co-geeks to Matrix by:

1. Sending them a link to <http://matrix.funkypenguin.co.nz>, or
2. Send them a direct link to our "space", [#geek-cookbook](https://matrix.to/#/#geek-cookook:matrix.funkypenguin.co.nz) 

## How do I search?

Maybe it's just my years of using Discord, but I expected to be able to enter any search string in the main "search" field in my Matrix client, and have the relevant messages surfaced. Turns out, that's not how it works! The primary "search" field in the Elements UI, for example, searches **room names** (*i.e., show me all the rooms matching the string "chat"*). To search **within** a room, it's necessary to first navigate to that room, and then "room search" is a contextual action you can take **within** the room. I've not yet found out how do a partial string match though (*"chatgpt" matches, but "chatgp" does not*).

## Formatting your message

Discord supports minimal message formatting using [markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-).

!!! tip "Editing your most recent message"
    You can edit your most-recent message by pushing the up arrow, make your edits, and then push `Enter` to save!
