# How to geek out in [m]atrix

If you're hesitant to dip your toes into the wall-garden of our [Discord server](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz), then Matrix is the place for you!

!!! question "Eh? What's this federated chat thing? Who own my data? (/puts on tin-foil hat) !!"
    Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

    1. Native markdown for code blocks
    2. Drag-drop screenshots
    3. Costs nothing, no ads
    4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## How do I join the Matrix server?

1. If you already have a matrix account, you can use it to access our server (the magic of federation). See the channels list below for details
2. If you don't have an account yet, [create one](https://m.fnky.nz), using your email address, or just login with GitHub
3. Use the WebUI, or get one of the [many available](https://matrix.org/clients/) mobile / desktop clients
4. Join the channels you're interested in (*below*)! and say hi!

## How do I search?

Maybe it's just my years of using Discord, but I expected to be able to enter any search string in the main "search" field in my Matrix client, and have the relevant messages surfaced. Turns out, that's not how it works! The primary "search" field in the Elements UI, for example, searches **room names** (*i.e., show me all the rooms matching the string "chat"*). To search **within** a room, it's necessary to first navigate to that room, and then "room search" is a contextual action you can take **within** the room. I've not yet found out how do a partial string match though (*"chatgpt" matches, but "chatgp" does no*t).

## How do I suggest something?

1. Find the #completed channel (*under the **Suggestions** category*), and confirm that your suggestion hasn't already been voted on.
2. Find the #in-flight channel (*also under **Suggestions***), and confirm that your suggestion isn't already in-flight (*but not completed yet*)
3. In any channel, type `!suggest [your suggestion goes here]`. A post will be created in #in-flight for other users to vote on your suggestion. Suggestions change color as more users vote on them.
4. When your suggestion is completed (*or a decision has been made*), you'll receive a DM from carl-bot
